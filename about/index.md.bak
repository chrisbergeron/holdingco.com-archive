I’m a Sr. Linux DevOps Engineer and technologist in Atlanta, GA. I began working with computers when I was about 13 years old and I’ve loved them ever since. My first computer was a TRS-80 and I’ve worked with every major platform since. My current system preference is Linux, but I also use Mac OS X and Windows. I have numerous interests and I document many of them here. In 1999 I created one of the worlds first carputers: [the dashpc](http://dashpc.org) and in 2003 I started the [Linux Automotive interface](http://freshmeat.sourceforge.net/projects/dashpc/) [(also here)](http://sourceforge.net/projects/dashpc/). I stopped work on the Linux Automotive project several years ago. In 2006, I was interviewed for [O’Reilly’s Release 2.0 Magazine](http://radar.oreilly.com/r2/).

Some of my projects have been featured in multiple publications:<table><tr><td><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/release-2-issue-6.csp?intcmp=il-npa-ebooks-radar-release-2"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/cyberge/image/upload/v1531797160/icons/release_2.0_december_2007b-232x300_kj081b.jpg" width=150></a></td><td><a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Geek+My+Ride%3A+Build+the+Ultimate+Tech+Rod-p-9780764578762"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/cyberge/image/upload/v1531797150/icons/Book_Cover_Geek_My_Ride_16_Feb_2005_Official_medium_wlkrqk.jpg" width=150></a></td><td><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596008710.do"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/cyberge/image/upload/v1531797098/icons/Book_Cover_Car_PC_Hacks_medium_juonwv.jpg" width=130></a></td></tr></table>
