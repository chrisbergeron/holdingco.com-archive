This page highlights some projects that I'm working on or have worked on.

Im a Sr. Linux DevOps Engineer and technologist in Atlanta, GA. I began working with computers when I was about 13 years old and Ive loved them ever since. My first computer was a TRS-80 and Ive worked with every major platform since. My current system preference is Linux, but I also use Mac OS X and Windows. I have numerous interests and I document many of them here. In 1999 I created one of the worlds first carputers: [the dashpc](http://dashpc.org) and in 2003 I started the [Linux Automotive interface](http://sourceforge.net/projects/dashpc/). I stopped work on the Linux Automotive project several years ago. In 2006, I was interviewed for [OReillys Release 2.0 Magazine](http://radar.oreilly.com/r2/).
